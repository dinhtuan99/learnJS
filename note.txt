Six Phases of The Event Loop
Timers - executes callbacks using timers. If there are timers set to 0 ms or setImmediate(), they will run here. Incomplete timers will run in later iterations of the loop.
Pending - internal phase
Idle/Prepare - internal phase
Poll - process I/O callbacks
Check - execute any setImmediate() timers added in the Poll phase
Close - loop continues if there are more timers or I/O calls. If all timers and I/O calls are done, the loop closes and the process ends.
