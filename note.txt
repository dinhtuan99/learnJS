Six Phases of The Event Loop
Timers - executes callbacks using timers. If there are timers set to 0 ms or setImmediate(), they will run here. Incomplete timers will run in later iterations of the loop.
Pending - internal phase
Idle/Prepare - internal phase
Poll - process I/O callbacks
Check - execute any setImmediate() timers added in the Poll phase
Close - loop continues if there are more timers or I/O calls. If all timers and I/O calls are done, the loop closes and the process ends.

Version Package json
Pay special attention to the version listed. The format is as follows.

First number = major version
Second number = minor release
Third number = patch
The version states what was installed, but it also clarifies how it can be updated should you remove the node_modules and package-lock.json files and reinstall all dependencies with $ npm install.

The additional included characters (or lack thereof) tell npm how to maintain your dependencies.

* means that you'll accept all updates
^ means that you'll only accept minor releases
~ means that you'll only accept patch releases
>, >=, <=, < are also valid for saying you'll accept versions greater/less/equal to the listed version
|| allows you to combine instructions "prettier": "2.2.1 || >2.2.1 < 3.0.0" which says use prettier greater than 2.2.1 and less than version 3.0.0
You can also leave off a prefix and only accept the listed version
